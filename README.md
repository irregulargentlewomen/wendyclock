##About
On June 25, 2013, Texas state senator Wendy Davis waged a talking filibuster to kill [SB5](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/831/billtext/html/SB00005E.htm), a Republican-backed bill that would [close most Texas abortion clinics](http://www.prochoicetexas.org/in-our-state/sb537.shtml). As Davis’s filibuster looked more and more likely to succeed, her opponents used increasingly questionable tactics to force a vote before midnight, the end of the special legislative session. At 12:02 AM on June 26, the Texas Senate’s GOP leadership called a vote on the bill, in defiance of the chamber’s own rules, and declared victory. Davis’s supporters, both those in the gallery and [the 182,000](https://twitter.com/TexasTribune/status/349768681733107713) who watched on the <em>Texas Tribune</em>’s live feed, used the Senate’s own rules to force the GOP to nullify the invalid vote.
